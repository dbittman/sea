This software builds the toolchain needed to compile seakernel
(available on github at dbittman/seakernel). It also contains scripts
to build or install ported applications for SeaOS. 

Build Instructions
------------------
You must have seakernel checked out in a child directory of this
repo, named 'seakernel'.

Requirements:
loop devices in /dev that are accessible by a normal user.
the ability to mount that loop device on ./mnt (fstab entry is printed
in ./configure)

Commands:
./configure
make toolchain
make apps
make man
make config
make newhd
make all

then to test in Qemu: make all test
