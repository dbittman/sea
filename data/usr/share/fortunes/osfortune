"The straightforward and easy path was to join the proprietary software
world, signing nondisclosure agreements and promising not to help my
fellow hacker....  I could have made money this way, and perhaps had fun
programming (if I closed my eyes to how I was treating other people).
But I knew that when my career was over, I would look back on years of
building walls to divide people, and feel I had made the world ugly."

"But the most reliable indication of the future of Open Source is its

"The reason for the success of this somewhat communist-sounding strategy,
while the failure of communism itself is visible around the world, is

say it follows some basic rules like it supported paging, then I would
be able to say, yes, Linux fundamentally supports that model."

"The funny thing is if you actually read those papers, you find that,
while the researchers were applying thier optomizational tricks on a
microkernel, in fact those same tricks could be applied to traditional
kernels to accelerate their execution."

"Computers and automation have become so ingrained and essential
