Latest public build of the Sea Operating System

-- Testing Instructions --
Provided is a hard drive image and a CD image. Currently, booting up on real
hardware is not officially support (since its not tested well). The CD is the
easiest way to make it boot up on real hardware.

With the HD image:
	* Use an emulator to boot up the OS. qemu -hda hd.img for example

With the CD image:
	* pop it in a computer and boot from it!
	-> If you have a computer with less than 512MB of memory:
		The OS wont boot up all the way! If it manages to get to the point where
		the OS says that it's out of memory, I'd count that as a success. That
		is, it didn't crash on your hardware and would probably have worked.


Some fun things to try:
	* cd to /usr/src/seaos-util and run `./configure --prefix=/; make; make install'. This will let you
	  compile the applications for seaos and install them.
	* cd to /usr/src/sea and run `./configure; make; make install'. This lets you recompile and install the
	  kernel.
	* use nano to edit files!
	* create users with `useradd joe' (or whatever login you want).
	* change your password with `passwd'!
	* run sh explode (if you're curious as to what this does, look at /bin/explode [its a shell script]).
	* play around with the included software!
	* read the man pages of various programs!
	  `man cat', for example
